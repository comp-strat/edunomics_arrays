# School Spending Arrays: Washington D.C., 2018-19
## A Computational Workflow to Visualize Per-Pupil Expenditures (for Edunomics Lab)
Arrays of school level spending across student poverty/disadvantage in Washington, D.C. Created to provide a code-only workflow for per-pupil expenditures, by request from [the Edunomics Lab](https://edunomicslab.org/). See {the D.C. Edunomics page](https://edunomicslab.org/dc/) for up-to-date data and results.

The code to create visuals using the 2018-19 school spending data for Washington, D.C. is in [dc/dc_arrays.ipynb](dc/dc_arrays.ipynb). The raw data is in that same folder and was taken from [the Office of the State Superintendent of Education's DC School Report Card Resource Library](https://osse.dc.gov/page/dc-school-report-card-resource-library). 

Here is an example visual:
